# KS2 Mastery Platform v2

This repository is a ground-up rebuild of the KS2 proof of concept.

The goal is not to polish the old prototype. The goal is to give the product a stable base that can carry all six KS2 exam subjects without turning English Spelling into a permanent special case.

## What is inside

- `index.html` and `styles/app.css`
  - A dependency-light shell that preserves the current visual direction.
- `src/platform/*`
  - Shared platform concerns: route state, learner profiles, subject registry, repository boundary, reward layer, shared rendering.
  - The subject registry now validates the module contract at startup so boundary mistakes fail early instead of surfacing as mid-render crashes.
  - The shared store now persists learners and subject UI through explicit repository contracts instead of writing directly to browser storage.
- `src/subjects/spelling/*`
  - The rebuilt English Spelling slice.
  - The legacy spelling engine is preserved and wrapped behind a clean service.
  - The spelling service now owns an explicit serialisable state contract, deterministic transitions, resume-safe restoration, and domain-event emission.
  - Spelling content now has a versioned draft/published content model. Learner runtime reads are pinned to the published release snapshot, not live draft rows.
- `src/subjects/placeholders/*`
  - Clean extension slots for Arithmetic, Reasoning, Grammar, Punctuation and Reading.
- `worker/*`
  - A Cloudflare-friendly backend with D1-backed repository routes, account-scoped spelling content, learner ownership checks, production sessions, and Worker-side OpenAI TTS proxying.
- `docs/*`
  - Audit, architecture, refactor plan, migration map, repository notes, state-integrity notes, a dedicated spelling-service contract note, and a direct spelling parity audit.
- `tests/*`
  - Node tests covering the spelling service, reward events, shared store, repository parity, state recovery, import/export round-trips including legacy spelling progress imports, subject runtime containment, and golden-path smoke flows.

## Status

English Spelling works in the new structure.

Production on `ks2.eugnel.uk` uses the API adapter by default after sign-in. Direct file/local mode, or `?local=1`, still uses browser storage for development only. The API adapter reports explicit persistence modes (`local-only`, `remote-sync`, `degraded`) so failed remote writes are visible instead of being treated as silent success. The Worker is D1-backed with learner ownership enforcement, atomic account / learner revision checks, idempotent request replay, account-scoped spelling content routes, and OpenAI TTS as the production dictation default.

The other five subjects are intentionally placeholders. They already have:

- subject identities
- dashboard cards
- subject tabs
- analytics slots
- settings slots
- learner hooks
- reward-layer hooks
- Cloudflare deployment and API boundaries

What they do not have yet is their own deterministic learning engine. That is deliberate.

## Quick start

### Open in a browser

You can open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder statically.

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Build and deploy

```bash
npm run check
npm run db:migrate:remote
npm run deploy
```

The Cloudflare scripts run Wrangler through `scripts/wrangler-oauth.mjs`, which deliberately removes `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` for that child process. This keeps deploys and remote D1 commands on the logged-in OAuth session even when the parent shell still has an old API token exported. The legacy `*:oauth` aliases remain for muscle memory, but the default scripts are already OAuth-safe.

## Core rebuild decisions

1. Subject engines are separate from the shell.
2. The game layer reacts to mastery instead of controlling learning flow.
3. Learner profiles belong to the platform, not to a single subject.
4. The spelling engine is preserved where it still adds value.
5. The real persistence boundary is a repository contract, not raw browser storage.
6. Persisted data is versioned and normalised at the repository boundary before the shell or subjects consume it.
7. Cloudflare deployment is treated as an adapter boundary, not as the application architecture itself.

## Important note

This reference rebuild is deliberately light on framework machinery. It is easier to inspect, easier to continue, and clearer as an architectural handoff.

If the next team wants to move the shell back onto React, the boundaries are now clean enough to do that without rewriting the spelling engine again.
